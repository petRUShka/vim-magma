# Vim magma plugin

Vim-magma is a vim plugin for the [Magma] computer algebra system. Vim-magma supports syntax highlighting and indentation for Magma.

[Magma]: http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/

## Installation

These instructions assume you use a bundler (e.g. [Vim-Plug]). In this case you should place following line in your vim config:

    Plug 'petRUShka/vim-magma'

[Vim-Plug]: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

## Built-ins

The [list](magma-builtins) of built-ins used is generated by

```sh
$ magmadoc=/path/to/magma/doc/html
$ cat $magmadoc/*.htm | sed -nr "s/^.*NAME = \"([A-Z][[:alnum:]]*)\".*$/\1/p" | sort > magma-builtins
```

Or on a recent OSX machine (with some brew stuff installed)

```sh
$ cat $magmadoc/*.htm | LC_ALL=C  sed -nE "s/^.*NAME = \"([A-Z][[:alnum:]]*)\".*$/\1/p" | sort -suf > magma-builtins
```

The file `magma-builtins` very useful for completion. Press `Ctrl-X/Ctrl-O` in insert mode to force completion.

That trick is stolen from [magma-mode], see [build_completion_table.sh].

You may find this list also useful for [rlwrap]. Use it with `magma -f magma-builtins` or install to `~/.magma_completions`.
